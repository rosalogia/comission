# Co-Mission

Co-Mission is a digital marketplace for physical art and art commissions of various forms, focused on allowing consumers to find art and artists according to the style and subject matter of their prior work. For casual consumers, Co-Mission promotes artists according to the consumer's stated and learned tastes. Co-Mission was built in Flask for HackUTD 2022. Co-Mission aims to bring a splintered network of commission and print artists together on one platform specially made for discovering art.
